# Aesthetics

- Lovecraftian (maybe HR Giger?)
- Cosmic horror, fear
- Madness, insanity -- up is down, colors are arbitrary, architecture is nonsensical, and the player hallucinates visuals and audio
- Pulsing vines
- Void below
- Mega-structures above and around
- Darkness, fog
- Chunks of the environment are invisible (unless you are very close)
